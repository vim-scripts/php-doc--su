characters.

{text} The tested string.

A |ctype_upper| example (using the default locale)

<?php >
  $strings = array('AKLWC139', 'LMNSDO', 'akwSKWsm');
  foreach ($strings as $testcase) {
      if (ctype_upper($testcase)) {
          echo "The string $testcase consists of all uppercase letters.\n";
      } else {
          echo "The string $testcase does not consist of all uppercase letters.\n";
      }
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  The string AKLWC139 does not consist of all uppercase letters.
  The string LMNSDO consists of all uppercase letters.
  The string akwSKWsm does not consist of all uppercase letters.



If an integer between -128 and 255 inclusive is provided, it is interpreted as
the ASCII value of a single character (negative values have 256 added in order
to allow characters in the Extended ASCII range). Any other integer is
interpreted as a string containing the decimal digits of the integer.
