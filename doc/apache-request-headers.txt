on failure.

Version Description 5.4.0 This function became available under FastCGI.

in Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE webservers, too.

|apache_request_headers| example

<?php >
  $headers = apache_request_headers();
  
  foreach ($headers as $header => $value) {
      echo "$header: $value <br />\n";
  }
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Accept: */*
  Accept-Language: en-us
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
  Host: www.example.com
  Connection: Keep-Alive



You can also get at the value of the common CGI variables by reading them from
the environment, which works whether or not you are using PHP as an Apache
module. Use |phpinfo| to see a list of all of the available environment
variables.
