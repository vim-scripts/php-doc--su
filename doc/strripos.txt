strripos -- Find position of last occurrence of a case-insensitive string in a
string

  int strripos(string haystack, string needle [, int offset])~

Find position of last occurrence of a string in a string. Unlike |strrpos|,
|strripos| is case-insensitive.

{haystack} The string to search in.

{needle} If {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an integer and
applied as the ordinal value of a character.

{offset} If specified, search will stop this number of characters counted from
the beginning of the string. If the value is negative, search will instead
start from that many characters from the end of the string.

Returns the numerical position of the last occurrence of {needle}. Also note
that string positions start at 0, and not 1.

If {needle} is not found, FALSE is returned.

This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean
value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "". Please read the section on
Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return
value of this function.

A simple |strripos| example

<?php >
  $haystack = 'ababcd';
  $needle   = 'aB';
  
  $pos      = strripos($haystack, $needle);
  
  if ($pos === false) {
      echo "Sorry, we did not find ($needle) in ($haystack)";
  } else {
      echo "Congratulations!\n";
      echo "We found the last ($needle) in ($haystack) at position ($pos)";
  }
?>

The above example will output:

  Congratulations!
     We found the last (aB) in (ababcd) at position (2)
