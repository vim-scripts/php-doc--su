eio_readahead -- Perform file readahead into page cache

  resource eio_readahead(int fd, int offset, int length [, int pri [, mixed callback [, mixed data]]])~

|eio_readahead| populates the page cache with data from a file so that
subsequent reads from that file will not block on disk I/O. See READAHEAD(2)
man page for details.

The file descriptor

Starting point from which data is to be read.

Number of bytes to be read.

The request priority: EIO_PRI_DEFAULT, EIO_PRI_MIN, EIO_PRI_MAX, or NULL. If
NULL passed, {pri} internally is set to EIO_PRI_DEFAULT.

{callback} function is called when the request is done. It should match the
following prototype:

  void callback($data, $result);

{$data} is custom data passed to the request. {$result} contains
request-specific result value; basically, the value returned by corresponding
system call.

Arbitrary variable passed to {callback}.

|eio_readahead| returns request resource on success or FALSE on error.
