mb_strcut -- Get part of string

  string mb_strcut(string str, int start [, int length [, string encoding]])~

|mb_strcut| extracts a substring from a string similarly to |mb_substr|, but
operates on bytes instead of characters. If the cut position happens to be
between two bytes of a multi-byte character, the cut is performed starting
from the first byte of that character. This is also the difference to the
|substr| function, which would simply cut the string between the bytes and
thus result in a malformed byte sequence.

{str} The string being cut.

{start} Starting position in bytes.

{length} Length in bytes.

{encoding} The {encoding} parameter is the character encoding. If it is
omitted, the internal character encoding value will be used.

|mb_strcut| returns the portion of {str} specified by the {start} and {length}
parameters.

|mb_substr| |mb_internal_encoding|
