header_register_callback -- Call a header function

  bool header_register_callback(callback callback)~

Registers a function that will be called when PHP starts sending output.

The {callback} is executed just after PHP prepares all headers to be sent, and
before any other output is sent, creating a window to manipulate the outgoing
headers before being sent.

Function called just before the headers are sent. It gets no parameters and
the return value is ignored.

Returns TRUE on success or &false; on failure.

|header_register_callback| example

<?php >
  header('Content-Type: text/plain');
  header('X-Test: foo');
  
  function foo() {
   foreach (headers_list() as $header) {
     if (strpos($header, 'X-Powered-By:') !== false) {
       header_remove('X-Powered-By');
     }
     header_remove('X-Test');
   }
  }
  
  $result = header_register_callback('foo');
  echo "a";
?>

The above example will output something similar to:

  Content-Type: text/plain
  
  a

|header_register_callback| is executed just as the headers are about to be
sent out, so any output from this function can break output.

Headers will only be accessible and output when a SAPI that supports them is
in use.
